		<p>Here, I will be choosing only the best scratch projects and put them onto this website. If you want a game updated or you want a new game please put it on the issues page: <a href="https://github.com/AwesomeKalin/scratch-online/issues">https://github.com/AwesomeKalin/scratch-online/issues</a> You may also put bug reports for my own projects!
