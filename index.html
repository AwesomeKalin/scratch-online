		<h3>The Archive for Scratch Projects</h3>
		<p>Here, I will be choosing only the best scratch projects and put them onto this website. If you want a game updated or you want a new game please put it on the issues page: <a href="https://github.com/AwesomeKalin/scratch-online/issues">https://github.com/AwesomeKalin/scratch-online/issues</a> You may also put bug reports for my own projects! But DO NOT submit bug reports for other projects as it's not my fault.<br />To launch downloaded games, extract the zip, tar.gz of 7z file (based on which one you downloaded) and double click the index.html.<br /><b>THIS REQUIRES A HTML5 COMPATIBLE BROWSER!!!<br />[⭐UPD2] D O D G E 2 (By icmy123): </b><a href="games\Dodge2\v1">Link to game</a> <a href="downloads\Dodge2\v1">Link to Downloads</a> <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/380588624">Version on Scratch</a><br /><b>2048 [Remake] (by TimMcCool): </b><a href="games\2048 [Remake]\v1">Link to game</a> <a href="downloads\2048 [Remake]\v1">Link to Downloads</a> <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/382035329">Version on Scratch</a><br /><b>Arrow [Collab] (by kevin_eleven_1234): </b><a href="games\Arrow [Collab]\v1">Link to game</a> <a href="downloads\Arrow [Collab]\v1">Link to Downloads</a> <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/125775513">Version on Scratch</a><br /><b>Ball Runner 3D! ✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪ (by atomicmagicnumber): </b><a href="games\Ball Runner 3D! ✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\v1">Link to Game</a> <a href="downloads\Ball Runner 3D! ✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\v1">Link to downloads</a> <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/396828828/">Version on Scratch</a><br /><b>Brain Game (by Me!): </b><a href="games\Brain Game\v1">Link to game</a> <a href="downloads\Brain Game\v1">Link to Downloads</a><br /><b>Bubble Jump (by Jumper133): </b><a href="games\Bubble Jump\v1">Link to Game</a> <a href="downloads\Bubble Jump\v1">Link to Downloads</a> <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/306407568/">Version on Scratch</a><br /><b>Cards (GoldenEagleStudios): </b><a href="games\Cards\v1">Link to Game</a> <a href="downloads\Cards\v1">Link to Downloads</a> <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/397059848/">Version on Scratch</a><br /><b>Catch The Dots (by Me!): </b><a href="games\Catch The Dots\v1">Link to Game</a> <a href="downloads\Catch The Dots\v1">Link to Downloads</a><br /><br /><a href="https://sheeptester.github.io/words-go-here/scratch3-htmlifier"><b><i>Thanks to Sheeptester for making a Scratch 3.0 HTMLifier</b></i></a></p>
